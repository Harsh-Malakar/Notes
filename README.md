Good question. Here are some free (or mostly free) resources + TryHackMe rooms for learning radare2 + crack-me style reversing:

On TryHackMe

There is a room called CC: Radare2 on TryHackMe. According to a writeup, it’s free. 

This room teaches common radare2 commands, debugging, patching, etc. 

As per a TryHackMe roadmap, CC: Radare2 is part of their reverse-engineering path.

Other Free Radare2 / Crackme Resources

If TryHackMe doesn’t fully cover what you want, here are some external free resources:

1. GitHub – Radare2 Tutorial

The repo “ifding/radare2-tutorial” has many examples including crackmes. 

It covers basic commands, navigating binaries, debugging, and reverse engineering real crackmes.



2. Official Radare2 Book / Tutorials

There’s a “Using r2” guide for crackmes via the official Radare2 book. 

This gives detailed explanations of r2 commands plus how to reverse simple binaries.



3. PDF / Slides

“Radare from A to Z” — a PDF guide covering a lot of r2 fundamentals. 

“Reversing with R2” by pancake — good for understanding static/dynamic analysis. 



4. YouTube

Quick tutorial: “Quick tutorial radare2 and first crackme” by Daniel Sc4. 

This helps you see radare2 in action on a real crackme.

Suggestion for Learning Path

Start with the TryHackMe CC: Radare2 room — it’s hands-on and structured.

Use the GitHub tutorial (ifding) for practicing crackmes that are more varied.

Refer to PDF guides (Radare from A to Z, Reversing with R2) for deeper understanding.

Watch the YouTube tutorial to visually see how someone interacts with radare2.

If you like, I can pick 5–6 completely free courses (videos + writeups) just for radare2 + reverse engineering (especially with crackmes) — do you want me to do that?
